# Development Progress - 500 Top Albums Countdown

## Project Overview
A full-stack web application for tracking progress through Rolling Stone's Top 500 Albums of All Time (2020 edition). Users systematically listen to albums from #500 to #1, tracking progress and rating albums.

## Completed Features ‚úÖ

### Backend (Flask)
- [x] **CORS Support** - Configured for frontend communication on localhost:5173
- [x] **JWT Authentication** - Token-based auth with 24-hour expiration
- [x] **Database Models** - All 4 core models implemented:
  - User (authentication)
  - Album (static album data)
  - UserProgress (tracks current position)
  - UserRating (stores user ratings)
- [x] **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login with JWT token
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
  - `GET /api/progress` - Get user's current album
  - `POST /api/progress/complete` - Mark album complete & advance
  - `GET /api/albums` - Get all albums list
  - `POST /api/ratings` - Submit album rating (1-5 stars)
  - `GET /api/ratings` - Get user's ratings history
- [x] **Database Setup** - PostgreSQL with migrations applied
- [x] **Data Seeding** - All 500 albums loaded from CSV

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- [x] **Authentication System**:
  - AuthContext for global auth state
  - JWT token storage and management
  - Axios interceptors for auth headers
- [x] **Core Components**:
  - Login/Signup pages with form validation
  - Navigation bar with user info & logout
  - ProtectedRoute wrapper for auth-required pages
  - CurrentAlbum - Main countdown interface
  - AlbumRating - 5-star rating component
- [x] **Routing** - React Router with protected routes
- [x] **Styling** - Clean, typography-focused design
- [x] **Error Handling** - Loading states and error messages

### Infrastructure
- [x] Python virtual environment setup
- [x] Node.js upgraded to v20.19.3
- [x] All dependencies installed and working
- [x] Development servers configured

## Current Application Flow
1. User registers/logs in ‚Üí JWT token stored
2. Redirected to countdown page (protected route)
3. Shows current album (starting at #500)
4. User can mark as complete ‚Üí optional rating ‚Üí advance to next
5. Progress tracked in database

## Pending Features üìã

### High Priority
- [ ] **Onboarding Component** - Allow users to select starting album instead of defaulting to #500
- [ ] **User Dashboard** - Display:
  - Current progress (e.g., "50/500 albums completed")
  - List of rated albums with filters
  - Statistics (average rating, etc.)
- [ ] **Album Search/Browse** - View all 500 albums, search by artist/title

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Album Details Enhancement**:
  - Spotify/Apple Music integration links
  - Album cover art (via API)
  - Release year display
- [ ] **Social Features**:
  - Public profiles
  - Share progress
  - Compare ratings with friends
- [ ] **Progress Visualization**:
  - Progress bar/chart
  - Milestone celebrations
- [ ] **Mobile Responsive Design** - Optimize for mobile devices

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Export Features** - Download ratings as CSV/PDF
- [ ] **Recommendation Engine** - Based on user ratings
- [ ] **Achievements/Badges** - Gamification elements
- [ ] **Testing Suite** - Unit and integration tests
- [ ] **Production Deployment**:
  - Environment variables
  - Production database
  - Hosting setup (Heroku/Railway/etc.)
  - Domain configuration

## Known Issues üêõ
- [ ] No session persistence check on app load (need to verify JWT validity)
- [ ] No rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Missing password strength requirements
- [ ] No email verification on registration
- [ ] Album descriptions might be truncated in CSV

## Next Development Session
Recommended priorities:
1. **Onboarding Component** - Better user experience for new users
2. **User Dashboard** - Essential for tracking progress
3. **Session Persistence** - Check JWT on app load and refresh user state
4. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Many users will access on phones

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Move API base URL to environment variable
- [ ] Add PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety
- [ ] Implement proper logging on backend
- [ ] Add database indexes for performance
- [ ] Implement pagination for albums list
- [ ] Add request/response interceptors for better error handling

## Git Configuration

### Branch Rename
The default branch has been renamed from `master` to `main`. To complete the migration:
1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Change the default branch from "master" to "main"
3. Then run: `git push origin --delete master`

### Pre-commit Hooks
Pre-commit hooks are configured but need to be installed:
```bash
./setup-pre-commit.sh
```

This will install hooks for:
- Python: Black (formatting), Flake8 (linting), isort (imports)
- JavaScript: Prettier (formatting), ESLint (linting)
- General: trailing whitespace, file size checks, etc.

## Development Commands

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python run.py
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Database
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
flask db migrate -m "Description"
flask db upgrade
python seed.py  # Seed album data
```

## Architecture Notes
- Frontend runs on port 5173 (Vite dev server)
- Backend runs on port 5000 (Flask)
- PostgreSQL database: albums_countdown_db
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Album progression is countdown style (#500 ‚Üí #1)
