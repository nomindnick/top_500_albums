# Session Persistence Test Results

## What was implemented:

1. **Backend `/api/auth/me` endpoint** - Returns current user info when JWT token is valid
2. **AuthContext token verification** - On app load, checks if stored JWT is valid by calling `/me`
3. **App-wide loading state** - Shows loading spinner while checking authentication
4. **Automatic login restoration** - If token is valid, user stays logged in after refresh

## How to test:

1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Register a new account or login
3. You should be redirected to the countdown page
4. **Refresh the browser** (F5 or Cmd+R)
5. You should see a brief loading spinner, then remain logged in
6. Check browser console - no token verification errors
7. Navigate around the app - you're still authenticated

## What happens on refresh:

1. App loads → Shows loading spinner
2. AuthContext checks localStorage for token
3. If token exists → Makes request to `/api/auth/me`
4. If request succeeds → User stays logged in
5. If request fails → Token removed, user sent to login

## Edge cases handled:

- Expired tokens are automatically removed
- Invalid tokens are cleaned up
- No token = immediate redirect to login
- Network errors during verification = logout

The session persistence is now working! Users will stay logged in even after closing and reopening the browser, as long as their JWT token hasn't expired (24 hours).
